# ErwinJr_MATLAB
ErwinJr_MATALB is an open source design and simulation of multiple quantum well heterostructure devices. 
The program calculates the confined energy levels and the spacial distribution of the electron probability 
wave in the conduction band. The Schrodinger equation is solved based on the semiclassical approach. 
That is, the entire heterostructure is treated as a single quantum mechanical system with a well-defined Hamiltonian. 
The eigenstates are stationary without considering the coherent time evolution. The effective mass of the 
electrons is energy and spacial dependent based on kp theory and the heterostructure of the material system. 
The lifetime of the electron on a energy level is based on the LO phonon scattering lifetime. It is 
calculated using Fermi's golden rule and Frolich Hamiltonian.
